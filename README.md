## Blog Recipe to Cart

### Add list of items to cart for say aa Recipe
Add a list of items such as in a recipe to the cart from blog page on Shopify.

* Takes you to cart page not checkout page
* Different for each Article
* Can change the quantity of each item (Which you can't do with Permalinks)

## Product Price Label Changed with Tags

If you want to get more specific then you will add these tags to the product and it will over ride the default price text, which i have set to '$10.00 each'. - [link](Product_Price_Label_with_Tags)

```
Default all product prices say (e.g. $10.00 each)
